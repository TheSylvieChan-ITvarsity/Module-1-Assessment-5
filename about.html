            <p>This website was created by Pieter van der Linde while working through the 1st module
            of the ITvarsity Apprepreneur course. 
            </p>
            <p>It was made following along the example app given during the course, namely a
            Superhero App with images and stats of a few of Marvel's Avengers.
